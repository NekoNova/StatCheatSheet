# StatCheatSheet
StatCheatSheet simply shows the three milestone abilities for each class and role.  Just click the class icon and you'll see the class's two roles, with the three primary state for that class/role, in order.

This is just a handy tool to remind yourself in-game, especially if you're crafting for an alt.

Just type /scs to open StatCheatSheet.
